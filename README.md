# Linking outdoor play, contact with nature, and health in children in Belgium

The aim of the B@seball project is to uncover the link between contact with nature and health in children in Belgium.
In this thesis, we investigate a part of the survey data from this project using confirmatory factor analysis and structural equation modelling.
We track the progress of the thesis and share all code in this repository.
