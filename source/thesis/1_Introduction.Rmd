# Introduction

## The B@seball project

B@seball (Biodiversity at School Environments Benefits for ALL) is a [\text{\underline{BELSPO project}}](http://www.belspo.be/belspo//brain2-be/projects/BatSEBALL_N.pdf) (BRAIN-be 2.0 call) that started in 2019 and has funding for almost 5 years.
Project partners are the University of Antwerp,  Sciensano, Goodplanet, UC Louvain, [\text{\underline{MOS}}](https://www.mosvlaanderen.be/), and INBO [@baseballwebsite]. The main aim of the B@seball project is to investigate whether and how biodiversity at the school environment can influence the students' physical and mental health. 

For this purpose, over 500 children between 10 and 12 years old from 36 different schools in Belgium were recruited.
The schools were selected with statistical matching such that each school with lots of greenery always had a statistically close match (socio-economics, size, geographical location) with a school that has little greenery.
In the thesis, we will refer to green playgrounds as playgrounds that have many trees, many shrubs, flowers, sand, dirt, and maybe even a water feature or a vegetable patch.
In contrast, grey playgrounds typically have a concrete or tiled floor with maybe a couple of trees or some grass (Figure \@ref(fig:playgrounds)).

```{r playgrounds, fig.cap = "a comparison of a green (top) and grey (bottom) playground.", out.width = "3in"}
knitr::include_graphics(find_root_file("figures", "green_playground.jpg",
                   criterion = has_file("baseball_thesis.Rproj")))
```

The main data collection consisted of cheek swabs that were analysed to get each child's microbiota which, in turn, is a proxy for the children's physical health. The main research question that will be investigated by the project's team of researchers is whether greenery in schools influences the children's microbiota and, in turn, their health. 

Additionally, children, their parents and school guardians were asked to fill in questionnaires. These questionnaires are the main focus of this research.

Both the microbiota data and the data from the questionnaires were cleaned and analyzed to investigate the main research questions. From the beginning, the project team aspired to publish the cleaned data as an open, freely-accessible data set. As such, the data can now be freely used by others to test their own hypotheses. The data is anonymized and organized according to the [\text{\underline{Frictionless Data Package standard}}](https://specs.frictionlessdata.io/data-package/), and is currently accessible through [\text{\underline{Zenodo}}](https://zenodo.org/records/10527033) [@van_calster_2024_10527033]. 

## Research questions

### Children's questionnaire

The children's questionnaire was filled in by approximately 500 children. It included questions on the children's **Attitude Towards Outdoor Play (ATOP)**  which is measured through eleven statements that are scored on a likert scale [@beyer2015development]. The original statements had a Chronbach alpha of 0.79 on both subscales (ATOP_benefits and ATOP_fears). ATOP_benefits is high if the child recognizes that playing outdoors has many benefits. ATOP_fears is high if the child has a lot of fears related to playing outdoors. The original standardized scale questions were translated in Dutch and French to accommodate the children's language. One scale item on people using drugs was removed from the scale since it was deemed irrelevant for children between 10 and 12 years old.
This leads us to our first research question.

RQ1: Do the two subscales in the translated ATOP reliably measure the corresponding concepts?

A second set of scale questions was based on Nature England's monitor of engagement with the natural environment or *Nature Connectedness* (NC) survey [@hunt2017monitor]. Six affective statements on NC were translated in Dutch and French. The original statements had a Cronbach Alpha of 0.918 and 0.899 in adults and children respectively.  This leads us to our second research question.

RQ2: Is the translated NC scale still a reliable measure of the corresponding concept?

### Parents' questionnaire

Only around 300 parents of the approximately 500 children filled in a questionnaire. They firstly answered questions on their children's environment and health, socio-economic status, and cultural background. 

Based on @jelleyman2019cross, parents were also asked about their child's outdoor sports, outdoor activities, participation in "risky play categories" such as climbing trees and push-and-pull games, and the independent mobility of their child [@shaw2013children].

The **Risk Engagement and Protection Survey (REPS)** measures two underlying factors [@olsen2018risk; @shaw2013children; @jelleyman2019cross]. The first factor, "protection from injury", is scored high if parents want to protect their children from injury. The second factor, "engagement with risk", is scored high if the parents encourage their children to engage with risky behavior. All questions were translated in French and Dutch.

RQ3: Can both dimensions in the translated REPS questionnaire be reliably measured?
:::

::::

<!-- Finally, there were some questions on independent mobility of the child, based on @shaw2013children. These questions have not been confirmed to measure an underlying factor as the previous ATOP, REPS, and NC scale questions. They do question parents on how much freedom they allow their children to travel around their own neighbourhood or city without adult supervision. This survey on independent mobility was previously executed in England and Germany over the years, starting in 1971. Researchers concluded that there has been a large reduction in independent mobility for primary school children over the years. It would be interesting to compare the results obtained in Germany and England with Belgium. -->

<!-- ### School guardians' questionnaire -->

<!-- Around 60 school guardians filled in a small questionnaire. Next to some general demographic questions, they answered the same REPS questions as the parents. -->

### Overarching research questions

If all concepts (ATOP benefits, ATOP fears, NC, REPS "protection from injury", and REPS "risk engagement") can be reliably measured using the translated questionnaires, we can investigate the following research questions.

:::: {.center data-latex=""}

::: {.minipage data-latex="{.8\linewidth}"}
RQ4: Are ATOP dimensions in children related to their parents' REPS dimensions?

RQ5: Is the child's socio-economic status related to their NC, ATOP, or their parent's REPS dimensions?

RQ6: Is the type of school environment related to the children's ATOP and/or NC?

<!-- One might possibly also include the microbiota data and investigate: -->

<!-- - whether the parent's REPS is related to the child's microbiota. -->
<!-- - whether the child's socio-economic status is related to the child's microbiota. -->
<!-- - whether the child's ATOP is related to the child's microbiota. -->
